# Google Images Download
Python Script for 'searching' and 'downloading' hundreds of Google images/image links!

## Summary
This is a Python program to search keywords/key-phrases on Google Images and then also optionally download all Images. 

## Compatability
This program is written in Python 3.4 and can run on any version of Ptyhon (3.x). It is a download-and-run program with couple of changes according to requirements.

## Status
This is a small program which is ready-to-run, but still under development. Many more features will be added to it shortly.

## Usage
`search_keyword = ['Taj Mahal', 'Pyramid of Giza']`

This list is used to search keywords. You can edit this list to search for google images of your choice. You can simply add and remove elements of the list.

`keywords = ['','%20high%20resolution','%20paintings','%20at%20night','%20from%20top']`

This list is used to further add sufix to your search term. Each element of the list will help you download 100 images. First element is blank which denotes that no sufix is added to the search keyword of the above list. 

You can edit the list by adding/deleting elements from it. `%20` denotes a space.
